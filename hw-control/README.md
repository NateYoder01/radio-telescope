# Hardware Control
This folder holds code relating to the hardware control parts of the project (angle positioning, calibration, etc.). Most code here will probably be written in C/C++ for Arduino or ESP32.

### Control codes
`$> pos` (get position) returns position

`$> set (x, y)` (set position) sets a position

`$> trace (x1, y1, x2, y2, time)` traces out a sky line from (x1, x2) to (y1, y2) over time
